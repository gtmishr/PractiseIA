# PracticeIA

To develop our understanding of Java and some applications of it, we've decided, as a IB Year 11 HL Computer Science cohort, to complete a collaborative practise internal assessment (IA). The aim of the IA is to develop a digital mark-off solution for the CGS Code Cadets &amp; Robotics groups, which could be expanded on later if our class chooses to do so. The program will be programmed in Java, and all necessary IA documentation will be provided.

Alongside the fact that we're getting used to the format of an IB IA (and all the documentation required to complete one), this task is aimed to help us understand the language of Java better, as well as concepts in the IB HL Computer Science curriculum, such as object oriented programming, and the design processes required to develop a new software.
